An Effort Towards the Standardization of Disorientations in Texture

Texture analysis has been historically plagued by complications arising from differing orientation conventions. Recent work has helped alleviate this confusion, with two notable examples being the rotation representations from Rowenhorst et. al. 2015, and the misorientation fundamental zone conventions from Krakow et. al 2017. Many existing projects (MTEX, DREAM3D, ORIX , OIM, py4DSTEM, etc.) adopt or reference these standards, but these alone are insufficient to ubiquitously define disorientations between orientations. This can lead to difficult to diagnose errors when modeling relevant properties such as plastic deformation and fatigue. The current work builds on existing standards to define a unified set of texture conventions and includes an open-source repository of implementations in python. These can be adopted as-is by existing projects, but the primary intention is feedback from the community will help refine these conventions for an upcoming publication.
